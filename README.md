<h1>README Generator Using Node.js</h1>

> **Created by Chuck DeBrosse**

## Description
This application walks the user through a series of command line prompts that dynamically fills sections in a README.md template. That template is then exported and saved as a completely new file with all styling and formatting automatically applied. Countless hours will be saved simply by answering a few questions via your favorite CLI and applying those answers to a perfectly arranged README.md specific to your project.
